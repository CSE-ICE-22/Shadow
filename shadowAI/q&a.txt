1)why to chose sampling rate as given?
- in WESAD research they have select and they also used that
2)why to use the 60 seconds window, 5s overlap and the things?
-
3)Why LOSO for Stress Detection?
🔑 The Problem: Each person's heart rate patterns are UNIQUE!

Person A: Stress = 90 BPM, Normal = 70 BPM
Person B: Stress = 120 BPM, Normal = 100 BPM
❌ Traditional Split: Random 80/20 split mixes all subjects

Result: Model learns individual patterns, not general stress patterns
Real-world problem: Fails on new people!
✅ LOSO Split: Completely separate people for training/testing

Result: Model learns UNIVERSAL stress patterns that work for anyone
Real-world success: Works on completely new users!
