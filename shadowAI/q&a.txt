1)why to chose sampling rate as given?
- in WESAD research they have select and they also used that
2)why to use the 60 seconds window, 5s overlap and the things?
-
3)Why LOSO for Stress Detection?
üîë The Problem: Each person's heart rate patterns are UNIQUE!

Person A: Stress = 90 BPM, Normal = 70 BPM
Person B: Stress = 120 BPM, Normal = 100 BPM
‚ùå Traditional Split: Random 80/20 split mixes all subjects

Result: Model learns individual patterns, not general stress patterns
Real-world problem: Fails on new people!
‚úÖ LOSO Split: Completely separate people for training/testing

Result: Model learns UNIVERSAL stress patterns that work for anyone
Real-world success: Works on completely new users!

4)why you used this Butterworth bandpass filter?
Filter Type	Pros	Cons	Why Not Used
Chebyshev	Sharp cutoff	Ripple in passband	Ripple distorts BVP morphology
Elliptic	Sharpest cutoff	Ripple in both bands	Complex, overkill for BVP
Moving Average	Simple	Poor frequency response	Doesn't handle non-stationary noise
Butterworth	Flat passband	Gentle rolloff	Best for BVP

The Butterworth bandpass filter was chosen because it provides the optimal balance of:
‚úÖ Signal preservation (flat passband)
‚úÖ Noise rejection (effective cutoff)
‚úÖ Computational efficiency (simple implementation)
‚úÖ Clinical validation (proven effectiveness)
‚úÖ Real-time capability (suitable for wearables)
